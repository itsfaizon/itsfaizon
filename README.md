# Greetings!! I'm Jonathan Faizon Porter 
### Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | Data Center Technician | Linux Administrator

I bridge the gap between physical hardware and cloud-native architecture. I spend my days maintaining hyperscale servers for one of the world's largest clouds, and my nights architecting my own private cloud infrastructure using Docker and Linux.

## What I'm Building
- **Private Cloud Observability Stack:** A production-grade monitoring solution using **Prometheus & Grafana** to track real-time metrics across a Linux VPS. It's like building a "Google Maps Traffic Report" for server health.
- **High-Availability Game Networks:** Optimized **Linux** networking to host low-latency game servers (DayZ), managing UDP/TCP traffic flow and firewalls to ensure a 99.9% uptime.
- **The "Docker Jail" (In Progress):** A self-service Bash tool that provisions secure, sandboxed environments for guest developers, using **Docker** isolation.

## My Technical Toolbox
| Category | Tools & Skills | The "Real World" Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | Docker, Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana | The "City Planners" that keep the digital traffic moving. |
| **Infrastructure** | Linux (RHEL/Ubuntu), Hyperscale Ops | The "Foundation" of the skyscraper. I fix the physical servers. |
| **Security** | WireGuard, UFW, Wireshark, Nmap | The "Gatekeepers" and "Security Cameras" of the network. |
| **Automation** | Bash Scripting, Python | The "Robots" I build to do the repetitive chores for me. |
